/*	Maximum name length constants. */

/*	MAXPATH is the maximum size of a full filespec, including the server and
	port name (e.g. "NETBEUI!!!A Long Server Name/Iris!!dir1/dir2/file").

	MAXPATH must be capable of representing a full filespec not only on
	the local machine (that we're compiling for), but also capable of
	representing a full filespec on any remote server on any other platform!

	Because a full filespec, including fully expanded server names, can be
	quite long, we have a policy that if the buffer limit is reached when
	constructing a full path, OSPathConstruct (and others) return an error
	to the caller, which gets reported to the user (rather than trying to
	open a truncated filespec).

	The maximum length includes the terminating null so these maximums
	may be used in data declarations.  However, in places where a size
	is specified that indicates the maximum number of characters in the
	name, then the appropriate number minus 1 should be used.
*/

/* Before V4, MAXPATH was 256 for MAC, NLM & UNIX.  For others it was 100.
   Win95 which is now supported by V4 has long filenames, requiring the 
   MAXPATH to be increased to 256.  For old compatibility, we have defined
   OLDMAXPATH which is the same definition of MAXPATH in V3 and below.  The
   MAXPATH define in V4 is now 256 for all platforms.
