 * tie(WScrollBar *one, WScrollBar *two) functions, it is possible to tie to
 * scrollbars together, so that they will scroll together.
 *
 * Note: this apparently does not work with konqueror, but ChangeLog of khtml
 * shows that it has been added recently.
 *
 * In the future, a scrolled() signal will be added.
