 *  \brief A WWidget that may hold (and manage) children.
 *
 * A WContainerWidget acts as a container for child widgets.
 *
 * By default, a WContainerWidget is \link WWidget::setInline()
 * stacked \endlink and manages its children within a rectangle.  When
 * setting the WContainerWidget \link WWidget::setInline() inline
 * \endlink the container only acts as a conceptual container,
 * offering a common style to its children. Inline children are still
 * layed out inline within the flow of the parent container of this
 * container, as if they were inserted directly into that parent
 * container.
 *
 * FIXME: We still need to provide a method to specify an inline-block,
 * this is a container that itself has an inline layout, but that manages
 * it children in a block.
